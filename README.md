# CSE543_NBA_Project
Software Package for the CSE 543T project with Yang Yi, Levi Kaster, Allen Huang, and Patrick Norrick.

In this project we testest 5 different regression models for predicting the single-season points, rebounds, and assists of NBA Players. The models we tested were a kNN Regression model, a Linear Regression Model, A Random Forest Model, a Artificial Neural Network, and a Deep Neural Network.

# Duplication of Results 

1. [NBA_Player_CSV](https://github.com/kasterlevi/CSE543_NBA_Project/blob/main/NBA_Player_CSV.ipynb): This file gives the code necessary for obtaining the data that we used for training out models, and for duplicating the data preprocessing that we performed. In this code we pull the data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/. This code should be run first, in order to generate the CSV file named NBA_Player_StatsV2. 

    Alternatively the csv with the preprocessing already done can downloaded here [NBA_Player_StatsV2](https://wustl.box.com/s/mss2i89mx1f8me20ns7xqosdfarezzrn). After this pre-processed data is downloaded to your computer and saved in the location where you are going to run the code, our work can be duplicated.
