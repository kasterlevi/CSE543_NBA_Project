# CSE543_NBA_Project
Software Package for the CSE 543T project with Yang Yi, Levi Kaster, Allen Huang, and Patrick Norrick.

In this project we testest 5 different regression models for predicting the single-season points, rebounds, and assists of NBA Players. The models we tested were a kNN Regression model, a Linear Regression Model, A Random Forest Model, a Artificial Neural Network, and a Deep Neural Network.

# Duplication of Results 

1. [NBA_Player_CSV](https://github.com/kasterlevi/CSE543_NBA_Project/blob/main/NBA_Player_CSV.ipynb): This file gives the code necessary for obtaining the data that we used for training out models, and for duplicating the data preprocessing that we performed. This code should be run first to generate the CSV file named NBA_Player_StatsV2. 

    Alternatively the csv with the data preprocessing that we used can be downloaded here [NBA_Player_StatsV2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasterlevi/CSE543_NBA_Project/main/NBA_Player_StatsV2.csv)
